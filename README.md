# Histogram App

This is a web application that allows you to generate a histogram from a text file link and export the histogram data as a CSV file.

## Deployment

The web app is deployed and can be accessed at [https://histogram-ttt.netlify.app/](https://histogram-ttt.netlify.app).

## Libraries Used

The app is built using the following libraries:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Recharts: Charting library for React applications.
- react-csv: Library for generating CSV files in React.

## Plugins

The app utilizes the following plugins:

- Chart.js: JavaScript charting library used by Recharts.

## How It Works

1. On the app page, you will see a button labeled "Show Histogram".
2. Clicking the "Show Histogram" button triggers the generation of the histogram using the provided data.
3. The histogram is displayed on the page, showing the distribution of the data with a hovering effect.
4. Below the histogram, you will find an "Go Back" and an "Export" button.
5. Clicking the "Export" button downloads a CSV file containing the data used to generate the histogram and the "Go back" button will take you to the main page.

Feel free to explore the app and generate histograms.
